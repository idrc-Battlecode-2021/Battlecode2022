# First Bot

## Buildings
### Archons
#### Spawning
Tries to spawn evenly throughout all archons by informing each other of what spawn phase each one has passed
Spawn phases in order of priority:
- Miners: >=10
- - Increases # of miners spawned if Archon is near a lot of lead deposits
- Builders: >=3
- 2 watchtowers for every 1 lab until 3 labs are built
- Sages whenever there's enough gold
- watchtowers whenever there's enough lead
- repair nearby troops if none of the above

#### Changelog
- 1/5/2022 - decrease initial lab count 3 -> 2, added more spawn phases for more even spawning throughout all archons
- 1/6/2022 - work on watchtower lattice.
